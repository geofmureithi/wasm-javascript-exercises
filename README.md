# WASM & JS Talk and exercises

By Njuguna Mureithi @tweetofnjuguna

## Introduction

Habari!
I'm Njuguna Mureithi, a Senior Engineer from Nairobi, Kenya.

I started my coding journey in 2007 and sold my first software in 2010.
I write code every possible day and have done so gaining more than a decade of real work experience.
I enjoy learning new concepts and languages.
I'm currently involved a lot with Rust and Javascript with a little bit of C.

## Motivation

Why talk and sell WebAssembly?
- It is a W3C standard, supported by all major browsers
- It is faster than js (see Exercise 1)
- It is more secure than js
- It is universal (see Exercise 2)

Its also a chance to bring up a chance to talk about Rust :).

> Insert funny tweet about someone @ me on this.

## Why Rust?
- Safe concurrent programming - The ease with which this allows users to write efficient, thread-safe code.
- Static language, OG of WebAssembly
- Growing ecosystem, StackOverflow's most loved language for the 7th year!

## Exercises

In a goal to make this session interactive, we are going to look at some exercises.
These exercises will each tackle a specific concept:
- Exercise 1: Basics and how fast is WASM?
- Exercise 2: How would one run .wasm files in other platforms?
- Exercise 3: Can you build complex UIs in WASM?


## Requirements:
- `rust-lang` https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- `wasm-pack` https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/

After installation, please refer to each exercise's Readme file for the next instructions.
